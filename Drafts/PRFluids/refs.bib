  abstract = {Surface-active material is present in most naturally occurring water samples, and it naturally diffuses steadily to free surfaces, where it both reduces the surface tension and gives the surface elastic properties which enable it to resist compression. When the water flows so that the surface layer is trapped and compressed against a fixed shallow-draught barrier the film material makes the surface incompressible, and flow beneath the barrier forms a viscous boundary layer under the film. The stresses associated with this boundary layer are found to distort the surface in the region of the leading edge of the film, giving rise to a phenomenon which is commonly observed in nature and which has been called the Reynolds ridge. This paper describes experimental work on the measurement of the ridge, and compares the results with a theoretical model due to Harper \& Dixon. Good agreement is indicated.},

It is shown that the drop profiles can be predicted and that this leads to a relation between the edge velocity and the maximum slope, which occurs at an inflection point close to the edge. This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge. At thicknesses of this order, or possibly even larger, other effects become important, and some observations on edge behaviour are included.},

The spreading observed is characterized by the bulk part of a droplet spreading over a high density monolayer of water that forms within tens of picoseconds after the droplet is placed on the surface. The monolayer exhibits two spreading regimes, each following a power law in time with diﬀerent exponents, and the late stage is faster than that predicted by Tanner’s law. The bulk part of the droplet initially spreads over the monolayer with increasing radius until a characteristic time t*. Beyond t*, it shrinks while maintaining a constant contact angle and, interestingly, the radius is described well with a ﬁrst-principles model based on hydrodynamic theory. Overall, the simulation results qualitatively agree with recent experimental data.},

	abstract = {We study the spreading of droplets in a near-critical phase-separated liquid mixture, using a combination of experiments, lubrication theory and finite-element numerical simulations. The classical Tanner’s law describing the spreading of viscous droplets is robustly verified when the critical temperature is neared. Furthermore, the microscopic cut-off length scale emerging in this law is obtained as a single free parameter for each given temperature. In total-wetting conditions, this length is interpreted as the thickness of the thin precursor film present ahead of the apparent contact line. The collapse of the different evolutions onto a single Tanner-like master curve demonstrates the universality of viscous spreading before entering in the fluctuation-dominated regime. Finally, our results reveal a counter-intuitive and sharp thinning of the precursor film when approaching the critical temperature, which is attributed to the vanishing spreading parameter at the critical point., Tanner’s law describes the spreading dynamics of droplets made of Newtonian viscous fluids. Here, the authors demonstrate that this law remains valid for phase-separated binary liquids close to their critical point, and thus for all the associated universality class.},

	abstract = {Capillary ripples in thin viscous films are important features of coating and lubrication flows. Here, we present experiments based on digital holographic microscopy, measuring with nanoscale resolution the morphology of capillary ripples ahead of a viscous drop spreading on a prewetted surface. Our experiments reveal that upon increasing the spreading velocity, the amplitude of the ripples first increases and subsequently decreases. Above a critical spreading velocity, the ripples even disappear completely and this transition is accompanied by a divergence of the ripple wavelength. These observations are explained quantitatively using linear wave analysis, beyond the usual lubrication approximation, illustrating that new phenomena arise when the capillary number becomes of the order of unity.},

	abstract = {When a particle, such as dust, contacts a thin liquid film covering a surface it is trapped by the liquid. This effect is caused by the formation of a meniscus, resulting in a capillary force that makes the particle adhere to the surface. While capillary adhesion is well-characterised in static situations, the dynamic formation of the liquid bridge after the initial contact is highly intricate. Here, we experimentally study the evolution of a liquid bridge after a glass sphere is gently brought into contact with a thin viscous film. It is found that the contact creates a ripple on the thin film, which influences the growth of the meniscus. Initially, the ripple and the meniscus are coupled and exhibit similar dynamics. This initial regime is well accounted for by a scaling law derived from lubrication theory. At a later stage, the ripple is “detached” from the liquid bridge, leading to a second regime of bridge dynamics. As a result, capillary forces are time-dependent, highlighting the importance of dynamics on adhesion.},
