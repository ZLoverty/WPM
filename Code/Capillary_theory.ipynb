    "I propose a theory to explain whether we observe dimple or not in a thin liquid film. The core idea is the dimple is unstable because surface tension always has a tendency to smooth it out. To observe it, the surface tension induced flow has to be sufficiently small, so that the dimple stays longer. \n",

    "The dimple formation around a beet slice has two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial dimple formation due to the suction flow of the beet slice;\n",
    "2. The smooth-out due to the surface tension induced flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will model these two steps based on the physical picture depicted above. A simple numerical solution will be presented."
