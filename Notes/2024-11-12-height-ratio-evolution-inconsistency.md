# Height ratio evolution inconsistency

In the draft, I have a figure showing the evolution of height ratio from both simulation and experiment with corresponding parameters. The evolutions are comparable, but the difference is also noticeable. The most outstanding difference is that the simulation height ratio in the two examples both reach 0.5 later than the experimental counterparts. I explained this by arguing that the "second point strategy" exaggerates the surface depression induced by the contact line rise, giving rise to a lower starting point of the height ratio, and therefore a longer time to recover. If this is a consistent trend, we would expect larger dimple times for all the simulation data. However, in the dimple time data, we observe the opposite: most of the experimental dimple times are larger than the simulation counterparts. The only example shown in the height ratio evolution ($h_0\approx 0.33\;\mathrm{mm}$) has the dimple time right on the simulation line, instead of being smaller.

Apparently, there is some inconsistency between these two graphs. To find out, I'm going to check the height ratio evolutions for all the transient dimples one by one.

I do not have to finish this note, because my new experiment reveals that the inconsistency mainly arises from the difference in the film length. Once we have the length controlled, good agreement is observed between simulation and experiment.
