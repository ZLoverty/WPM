# Wettability of Porous Materials Project

Also know as the BEET project, in which we study the fringe around a beet slice.

We initially thought this fringe was induced by the porousness of the beet. After careful measurement and theoretical modeling, we identified the wetting on the beet surface as the main source of the "suction" flow. Below is a simple illustration of our finding.

A presentation of this project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yhSAJb_s5hPg7i-JsvLw4tsoSxmCTT8icr6oRAvLXgY/edit?usp=sharing).

A research paper is expected to come out soon.
