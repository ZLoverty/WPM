# Define dimple time

In the first draft, I define dimple time $t_{dimple}$ as the time it takes for the height ratio between the dimple and the bulk apex to reach 0.7. This definition has some issues:

- it is arbitrary;
- some thick liquid film would never reach this threshold ratio, yet they are apparently in a surface tension unfavorable morphology. For example, compare the two liquid films in the illustration below. The pressure gradient generated by the surface tension, which tends to smooth out the dimple, would be very similar. However, the height ratio would be very different. For the blue profile, the height ratio is around 0.7, while for the red profile, the height ratio is around 0.3.

Whether we observe the fringe depends on the height ratio, that's for sure. However, not seeing the fringe does not necessarily mean the dimple is absent. That said, having a dimple is a necessary condition to the fringe, but not sufficient. Therefore, using the criteria of fringe to indicate dimple property, i.e. use whether we can observe fringe to measure the time that a dimple stays around, is inappropriate.

To obtain a time scale for the dimple, the most direct observable is the curvature difference (between the liquid surface at the dimple and the apex). In the same blue-red example, the difference in maximum and minimum curvature of the two curves would be much closer. And this difference quantifies the surface tension force, which combined with the viscous drag, determines the dimple dynamics. 

Therefore, in this note, we explore the possibility of using curvature difference to measure dimple time. We start by plotting the curvature difference between dimple and apex over time for all the experiments, including those with beet juice (blue), vinegar (orange) and water (green). The results are shown below. Here, we choose an arbitrary threshold at curvature difference $\Delta h''=0.05$ mm$^{-1}$ as the dimple time definition. The dimple time $t_{dimple}$ as a function of initial thickness $h_0$ is also shown. We can observe that the general trend is consistent with the height ratio definition, where dimple time decreases with increasing initial thickness. However, compared to the height ratio definition, the curvature definition does not improve the data quality a lot, except that it adds more data points to the large $h_0$ end, which is considered "no dimple" in the height ratio definition.

The separation between the three liquids is also weak. We could perform a simulation to see what to expect from different viscosity and surface tension. The results are shown in the figure below. The experimental data points are the discs, and simulation data are plotted as dashed lines. The simulation suggests an expectation of dimple time: as surface tension increases, dimple time decreases for the same initial thickness. Indeed, when surface tension is large, the restoration force is large, which smooths out the dimple quickly. Viscous force serves as the damping force, which also slows down the smooth-out process. In the three liquids studied here, water has highest surface tension and lowest viscosity, beet juice has medium viscosity and surface tension, and vinegar has the highest viscosity and the lowest surface tension. As a result, water dimple smooths out the fastest, then beet juice, then vinegar. This is consistent with the simulation result. The experimental result is not 100% conclusive, but the trend is promising. However, due to the discrete nature of the measurement, we cannot resolve the short dimple time better.
