# Define dimple time

In the first draft, I define dimple time $t_{dimple}$ as the time it takes for the height ratio between the dimple and the bulk apex to reach 0.7. This definition has some issues:

- it is arbitrary;
- some thick liquid film would never reach this threshold ratio, yet they are apparently in a surface tension unfavorable morphology. For example, compare the two liquid films in the illustration below. The pressure gradient generated by the surface tension, which tends to smooth out the dimple, would be very similar. However, the height ratio would be very different. For the blue profile, the height ratio is around 0.7, while for the red profile, the height ratio is around 0.3.

Whether we observe the fringe depends on the height ratio, that's for sure. However, no seeing the fringe does not necessarily mean the dimple is absent. That said, having a dimple is a necessary condition to the fringe, but not sufficient. Therefore, using the criteria of fringe to indicate dimple property, i.e. use whether we can observe fringe to measure the time that a dimple stays around, is inappropriate.

To obtain a time scale for the dimple, the most direct observable is the curvature difference. In the same blue-red example, the difference in maximum and minimum curvature of the two curves would be much closer. And this difference quantifies the surface tension force, which combined with the viscous drag, determines the dimple dynamics. 

Therefore, in this note, we explore the possibility of using curvature difference to measure dimple time.
